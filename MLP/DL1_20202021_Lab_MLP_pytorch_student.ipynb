You will write the loop to perform 1000 epochs.\n","- **Model B**: using the Sequential class of pytorch\n","- **Model C**: a custom torch.nn.Module class for this.\n","\n","For Model B and C, you will use the ready made loss and optimization from the nn and optim packages. You can use the same code to optimize the parameters of Model B and C.\n","\n","### Loss\n","\n","Since we are dealing with a binary classification problem, we will use a Binary Cross Entropy loss (use ```torch.nn.BCELoss``` for Model B and C).\n","\n","### Parameters update/ Optimization\n","\n","For updating the parameters, we will use as optimizer a simple SGD algorithm (use ```torch.optim.SGD``` for Model B and C) with a learning rate of 0.1.\n","\n","Don't forget that an optimizer is applied to a set of parameters (```my_model.parameters()``` gives the parameters of the network for Model B and C).\n","Once the gradients have been computed (after the backpropagation has been performed), you can perform one step of optimization (using ```optimizer.step()``` for Model B and C).\n","\n","### Backward propagation\n","\n","Backpropagation is automatically performed in pytorch using the ```autograd``` package.\n","First, reset the gradients of all parameters (using ```optimizer.zero_grad()``` for Model B and C), then perform the backpropagation ```loss.backward()```.\n","\n","## Your task:\n","\n","You need to add the missing parts in the code (parts between
